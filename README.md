# Hamiltonian_Cycles
A brute force algorithm written in Python to find Hamiltonian cycles in square grids. Being brute force, it can only compute for grids with a side length of up to 4. No machine can compute the 2,958,148,142,320,582,656 graphs that this algorithm demands for even a side length of 6. This project is an exploration of algorithm design, computational complexity, and graph traversal, not optimization.
